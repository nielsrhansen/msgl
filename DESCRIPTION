Version: 2.2.1
Date: 2016-05-08
Author: Martin Vincent
Maintainer: Martin Vincent <martin.vincent.dk@gmail.com>
Description: Multinomial logistic regression with sparse group lasso penalty.
    Simultaneous feature selection and parameter estimation for classification.
    Suitable for high dimensional multiclass classification with many classes. The
    algorithm computes the sparse group lasso penalized maximum likelihood estimate.
    Use of multiple processors for cross validation and subsampling is supported through
    OpenMP. Development version is on github, please report package issues on
    github.
